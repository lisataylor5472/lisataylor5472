## Welcome 
<div align="center">
This hub currently includes my projects from Turing School of Design, as well as some self study projects.<br>
<br>
It's intended to be a collection of my efforts. So not everything is tip-top. <br>
If you dive deep you may see commit messages, pull request notes, and <br>
code comments that seem like they were written by a madman. <br>
Alas, it's just me giving it my best shot and having a little fun along the way.
